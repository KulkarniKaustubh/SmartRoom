# Code
### face_rec.py
This program takes a ton of time to execute. No image optimization.

### training.py and test.py
Image optimization is done here. Takes lesser time to execute but images are smaller (of course).<br>
The extra time taken is by the face_locations function. You can use haarcascade to reduce the time significantly.
